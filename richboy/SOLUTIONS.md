i tried to run the treasure file: no output

opened the file using a binary viewer. lots of 00000000 and 11111111 bytes

went over the file and removed all unreadable bytes. to get treasure.txt

noticed that the ending is (!)*+,-./01234536789:;<=>!?@ABC!DEFGHIJKLMNOP!QRST!U!TVWXYZ[\]^_
which (apart from a few exclamation marks) is in ASCII order.

opened the file with a VBA memory editor to see a similar pattern.

lots of ? and ~s
